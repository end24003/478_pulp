# Option A Deployment Guide: Multi-Scenario Comparison Dashboard

## What You're Deploying

A web app that compares **3 optimization scenarios simultaneously** - something Excel Solver cannot do efficiently. This demonstrates the power of Python for operations research.

**App Features:**
- Side-by-side comparison of 3 different scenarios
- Automatic optimization of all scenarios
- Visual comparison charts (throughput, product mix)
- Automatic insights and recommendations
- Real-time updates when parameters change

# Option B Deployment Guide: Monte Carlo Simulation

## What You're Deploying

A web app that runs **1,000+ optimization scenarios with uncertainty** - demonstrating probabilistic thinking and risk analysis that Excel Solver cannot efficiently do.

**App Features:**
- Run 100-2,000 Monte Carlo simulations
- Account for uncertainty in demand, capacity, and prices
- Probability distributions and confidence intervals
- Risk analysis: best case, worst case, expected value
- Interactive probability calculator
